    "Using Unified Modelling Language (UML) classes are represented as boxes with the class name on top. The inheritance relationship is represented by an arrow from the derived class pointing to the base class. The word extends is usually added to the arrow. \n",

    "Let’s say you have a base class Animal and you derive from it to create a Horse class. The inheritance relationship states that a Horse is an Animal. This means that Horse inherits the interface and implementation of Animal, and Horse objects can be used to replace Animal objects in the application.
